## Understanding Your Results

### The Verdict

You'll see one of three results:

#### ✅ YOUR PHOTO IS REAL (70-100%)
- **What it means**: We didn't find evidence of editing
- **Confidence**: High - The photo appears authentic
- **What to do**: Your photo looks genuine!

#### ⚠️ YOUR PHOTO MIGHT BE EDITED (40-69%)
- **What it means**: We found some unusual patterns
- **Confidence**: Medium - Results are uncertain
- **What to do**: The photo may have minor edits or quality issues. Check technical details.

#### ❌ YOUR PHOTO WAS EDITED (0-39%)
- **What it means**: We found clear signs of manipulation
- **Confidence**: High - The photo has been altered
- **What to do**: The photo has likely been edited with software.

### The Confidence Score

The percentage shows how certain we are:
- **90-100%**: Very confident
- **70-89%**: Confident
- **50-69%**: Somewhat confident
- **30-49%**: Uncertain
- **0-29%**: Very confident (about editing)

## What We Check

### 1. 📋 Photo Information (Metadata)
Every photo contains hidden data about:
- Camera model and settings
- Date and time taken
- Software used
- GPS location (if available)

**What we look for**: Missing data, inconsistent timestamps, signs of editing software

### 2. 🎨 Compression Levels (ELA)
When you edit and re-save a photo, edited areas get compressed differently than original areas.

**What we look for**: Bright spots in the ELA image showing different compression levels

### 3. 🔊 Digital Noise
Real cameras create consistent "noise" patterns across a photo. Editing disrupts these patterns.

**What we look for**: Inconsistent noise that suggests copy-paste or retouching

### 4. 🤖 AI Detection
Our AI analyzes thousands of subtle patterns humans can't see.

**What we look for**: Machine learning patterns that indicate manipulation

## Tips for Best Results

### ✅ DO:
- Upload original photos (not screenshots)
- Use JPEG or PNG formats
- Keep files under 10MB
- Use high-quality images

### ❌ DON'T:
- Upload screenshots of photos
- Use heavily compressed images
- Upload extremely small images
- Send photos through messaging apps first (they compress them)

---

## Common Questions

### "Why did my real photo fail?"
Several reasons:
- The photo was already edited (filters, cropping, etc.)
- It was sent through messaging apps that compress it
- It's a screenshot
- It was downloaded from social media (they modify photos)

### "Why did an edited photo pass?"
- Very subtle professional edits are hard to detect
- The editing was done before the first save
- The entire image was processed (no inconsistencies)

### "What if I'm not sure about the result?"
- Check the technical details (click "Show Technical Details")
- Try uploading the original file
- Consider the confidence score
- For important cases, consult a professional forensic expert

## Limitations

TrueTrace is a helpful tool, but it's not perfect:

### ✅ Good at detecting:
- Copy-paste edits
- Object removal/addition
- Face swaps
- Filter applications
- Significant retouching

### ⚠️ May miss:
- Very subtle edits
- Professional forensic-level manipulation
- Edits done before the first save
- Whole-image processing (same changes everywhere)

### ❌ Not suitable for:
- Legal evidence (not a certified tool)
- Medical imaging decisions
- Official documentation
- Insurance claims

**For official purposes, always consult certified forensic experts.**

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Invalid file type"
**Solution**: Use JPEG or PNG files only

### Error: "File is too large"
**Solution**: Compress your photo to under 10MB

### Error: "Analysis failed"
**Solution**: 
1. Try a different photo format
2. Check your internet connection
3. Refresh the page and try again

### Results seem wrong
**Possible causes**:
1. Photo was already edited
2. Screenshot instead of original
3. Downloaded from social media
4. Very subtle/professional editing

---

## Best Practices

### For Maximum Accuracy:
1. **Use original files** - Not edited, not screenshotted
2. **High quality** - Better resolution = better analysis
3. **Multiple checks** - Try different versions if available
4. **Context matters** - Consider where the photo came from

### For Privacy:
1. Close the browser tab when done (everything is deleted)
2. Use a private browser window if preferred
3. No account needed - completely anonymous
